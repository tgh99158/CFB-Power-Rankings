# CFB-Power-Rankings
I think the widely used CFB polls are too influenced by voter bias, team market values, and program reputations. So I decided to code my own NCAAF power rankings.

I would like to recognize Bill Radjewski, part of the code in these rankings is inspired by or from https://github.com/BlueSCar
