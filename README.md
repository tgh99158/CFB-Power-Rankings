# CFB-Power-Rankings
I think the widely used CFB polls are too influenced by voter bias, team market values, and program reputations. So I decided to code my own NCAAF power rankings.

Every Sunday afternoon I write this code into an excel file to improve visualization and run analysis. The finished product of my power rankings can be viewed at tylerhoylman.com

I would like to recognize Bill Radjewski, part of the code in these rankings is inspired by or from https://github.com/BlueSCar
